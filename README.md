# Tweetsent
Python app that uses a homemade Na√Øve Bayes ML algorithm and twitter mining to perform sentiment analysis on tweets, users, and user input and visualize it with a color gradient.

README:
This project requires re, csv, numpy, emoji, tweepy, and Tkinter if that isn't already builtin.  Make sure frontend.py, twitterdemo.py, nbv2.py and SentimentAnalysisDataset.csv are in the same folder. NOTE: SentimentAnalysisDataset.csv is more than 25 MB, so it can't be uploaded here. Email mcli@andrew.cmu.edu to get that file, because you need that to actually analyze the tweets correctly. If all four of those are there, only then will it run correctly. If you run frontend.py, that will start the app.
